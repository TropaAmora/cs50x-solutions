Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations we reduce the sample of trials that the program has to
run, so the data is not large enough to give the chance to every team to register a tournament
win, putting a greater emphasys on chance (or luck). As we increase the number of simulations
we start to get better data because it becames less reliable on luck since better teams, in
theory will win more. In my opinion, after 10000 simulations, the results became realistic
enough, but because of the random essence of the program, the higher the number of simulations
the closer the results are to reality.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 400 to 750 simulations, since there were
some outliers before 400 simulations.

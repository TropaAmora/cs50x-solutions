The average values from energy, valence and danceability from this listeners' top 100 songs are, respectively, 0.65906, 0.484443 and 0.71646. Resulting in
a sum of 1.859963.


This way of getting the "Audio Aura" could be poor, since the music samples are only the top 100 songs, and not the whole spectrum. It could be better if
the Aura was the sum of the average values multiplicated with a percentage of listenings, resulting in a more representive metric.
